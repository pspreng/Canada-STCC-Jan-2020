      It is a Monday in December 2019. We have an appointment at 6pm, Huntsman pub Sukumvit, Landmark hotel. I am 10 minutes late, Thomas sits near the entrance door to make sure he can catch me when I enter the watering hole. Bruno arrives five minutes later. We hug each other. Long time no see. It is indeed a nice reunion, especially with Thomas whom I have not seen for thirty months. We are here to catchup on the good old times when I still lived in the big Mango, Bangkok, the Venice of the orient. A few days earlier when I arrived at Suvarnabumi airport it felt like coming home. For more than twenty years this was my home. I am homesick to this ugly, beautiful, stinky, good smelling town. 'How is Canada?' 'Fine, great, nice country, clean air, just bought a lovely dog, life is great over there'. Yes indeed I went the other way. The common case: burnt out ferangs from Europe and North America seek their last life adventure at places where the average temperature is above 25. I love Thailand and why would I ever want to swap for one of the coldest places on earth, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Bruno and Thomas have asked to write about my Canada adventure many times. I promised but never followed up. After all, you all have moved heavily in your lifetimes and business careers. Everyone has a unique and interesting stories, especially those arriving here in Bangkok. But the STCC newsletter needs stories. Few want to contribute. It took an order of chicken satay, a plate of spring rolls, a basket of french fries and four glasses of red wine to bribe me into writing this story. So remember this: I do not want to show off about moving from Thailand to Canada. Bruno forced me to do it, although, I have to admit, I have an emotional attachment to the newsletter. From 2014 to early 2017 I was the editor in chief of this international business magazine with focus on Thailand. I ran around to interview interesting members, talked to friends like Friedrich Kuster to publish inurance jokes, which, sadly, were dropped when I left the big mango. History is still preserved at the <a href="https://www.swissthai.com/newsletter">newsletter archive</a>.

      For foreigners, bringing up kids in Thailand is a challenge. The Thai education system offers little and most expat families send their children to international schools. The <a href="https://www.ris-swiss-section.org/">Swiss School Bangkok</a> and <a href="https://www.patana.ac.th/">Bangkok Patana School</a> are good examples. After graduation at the age of 18 most children will leave the country to persue further studies in Europe or North America. Our oldest son made up his mind early and wanted to go to Canada. My wife sent him off to Toronto (a typical Thai treat) and when she came back to Bangkok she started to rave about Canada. How nice this place was, how friendly their people and Asian food is everywhere. This was in fall 2016. We had two more kids in the graduation pipeline, and we started to think about our options more seriously. This was especially true when the first bills from the university of Toronto started to make a significant impact on our family budget. Moving to Canada seemed a viable option. The local fees are a quarter of those for international students and the quality of education is what we would expect from a developed country. While we were thinking of our options a news headline dropped on my computer screen.

       Wait a minute.... I know that guy with the long hair.... this is my professor from way back in the 1990s. A few e-mails later he invited my wife and me to Waterloo to see his laboratory. The new job in Waterloo, Canada was slated to start in April 2017. I am absolutely not religious but when things like this happen it is hard not to believe of some higher power.

       Immigration procedures are a nightmare everywhere, but in comparison with Thai immigration, the Canadians seem to embrace the 21st century. Still forms to complete but all online. After a few hundred clicks and a few weeks of waiting, I received enough documentation for our family to immigrate to Canada on a temporary work permit. Upon arrival at Toronto's Pearson airport we had to see the immigration officer who issued the permits and welcomed us to Canada. For the first two weeks we booked an apartment with Airbnb in Waterloo. We all enjoyed some good family time watching the Toronto Blue Js (baseball) loosing and the Raptors (basketball) winning. The kids were thrilled to see games in real stadiums. However the honeymoon period was over soon and my wife and two of the three kids returned to Bangkok for the next three months. Our middle son wanted to finnish his high school education in Bangkok since he only had one year left. Our daughter needed to finnish her secondary  degree to be ready to start Canadian high school in fall. So I was left alone to organize our future in Canada.
