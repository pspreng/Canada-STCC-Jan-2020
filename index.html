    <h1>Canada Thailand contribution STCC Jan 2020 </h1>
    It is a Monday in December 2019. We have an appointment at 6pm, Huntsman pub Sukumvit, Landmark hotel. I am 10 minutes late, Thomas sits near the entrance door to make sure he can catch me when I enter the watering hole. Bruno arrives five minutes later. We hug each other. Long time no see. It is indeed a nice reunion, especially with Thomas whom I have not seen for thirty months. We are here to catchup on the good old times when I still lived in the big Mango, Bangkok, the Venice of the orient. A few days earlier when I arrived at Suvarnabumi airport it felt like coming home. For more than twenty years this was my home. I am homesick to this ugly, beautiful, stinky, good smelling town. 'How is Canada?' 'Fine, great, nice country, clean air, just bought a lovely dog, life is great over there'. Yes indeed I went the other way. In the normal case burnt out ferangs from Europe and North America seek their last life adventure at places with the average temperature above 25. I love Thailand and why would I ever want to swap for one of the coldest places on earth, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Bruno and Thomas asked me to for this contribution. I thought this was a bad idea. Talking about a Swiss guy moving from Thailand to Canada. After all, you all have moved heavily in your lifetimes and business careers. Everyone has a unique and interesting stories, especially those arriving here in Bangkok. But the STCC newsletter needs stories. Few want to contribute. Why wasting time, time is money. It took an order of chicken satay, a plate of spring rolls, a basket of french fries and four glasses of red wine to bribe me into writing this story. So remember this: I do not want to show off about moving from Thailand to Canada. Bruno forced me to do it, although, I have to admit, I have an emotional attachement to the newsletter. From 2014 to 2017 I was the editor in chief of this international business magazine with focus on Thailand. I ran around to interview interesting members, talked to friends like Friedrich Kuster to publish inurance jokes, which, sadly, were dropped when I left the big mango. History is still preserved at the <a href="https://www.swissthai.com/newsletter">newsletter archive</a>. So here we are, you reading, me writing abou the move from exotic Thailand to cold Canada in March 2017.
