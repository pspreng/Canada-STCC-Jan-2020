            It is a Monday in December 2019. We have an appointment at 6pm, Huntsman pub Sukumvit, Landmark hotel. I am ten minutes late, Thomas sits near the entrance door to make sure he can catch me when I enter the watering hole. Bruno arrives five minutes later. We hug each other. Long time no see. It is indeed a nice reunion, especially with Thomas whom I have not seen for thirty months. We are here to catchup on the good old times when the big Mango, Bangkok, the Venice of the orient, was our home for more than twenty years. A few days earlier when I arrived at Suvarnabumi airport it felt like we never left. I am homesick to this ugly, beautiful, stinky, good smelling town. 'How is Canada? Fine, great, nice country, clean air, just bought a lovely dog, life is great over there'. Yes indeed I went the other way. The common case is for burnt out ferangs to seek their last life adventure at places where the average temperature is above 25 and living cost are still affordable. I love Thailand and why would I ever want to swap for one of the coldest places on earth, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Bruno and Thomas have asked to write about our Canada adventure many times. I promised but never followed up. After all, you all have moved heavily in your lifetimes and business careers. Everyone has unique and interesting stories, especially those arriving here in Bangkok. The STCC newsletter needs articles. Few want to contribute. It took an order of chicken satay, a plate of spring rolls, a basket of french fries and four glasses of red wine to bribe me into writing this, although, I have to admit, there is an emotional attachment to the STCC newsletter. From 2014 to early 2017 I was the editor in chief of this international business magazine with focus on Thailand, running around to interview interesting members, talking friends like Friedrich Kuster into publishing insurance jokes. Sadly, they were dropped when I left the big Mango in 2017. Luckily history is still preserved at the <a href="https://www.swissthai.com/newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter archive</a>.

            For foreigners, bringing up kids in Thailand is a challenge. The Thai education system offers little and most expat families send their children to international schools. The <a href="https://www.ris-swiss-section.org/" target="_blank">Swiss School Bangkok</a> and <a href="https://www.patana.ac.th/" target="_blank">Bangkok Patana School</a> are good examples. After graduation at the age of eighteen, most children will leave the country to pursue further studies in Europe or North America. Our oldest son made up his mind early and wanted to go to Canada. My wife sent him off to Toronto (a typical Thai treat) and when she came back to Bangkok she started to rave about Canada. How nice this place was, how friendly their people and Asian food is everywhere. This was in fall 2016. We had two more kids in the graduation pipeline, and we started to think about our options more seriously. This was especially true when the first bills from the university of Toronto started to make a significant impact on our family budget. Moving to Canada seemed  viable. The local fees are a quarter of those for international students and the quality of education is what one would expect from a developed country. While we were thinking,  a news headline dropped on my computer screen. <a href="https://www.ept.ca/2016/09/waterloo-led-groundbreaking-research-receives-fed-funding/" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank">Waterloo-led groundbreaking research receives Fed funding</a>. Wait a minute.... I know that guy with the long hair.... this is my professor from way back in the 1990s. A few e-mails later he invited my wife and I to Waterloo to see his laboratory. The new job in Waterloo, Canada was slated to start in April 2017. I am absolutely not religious but when things like this happen it is hard not to believe of some higher power.

             Immigration procedures are a nightmare everywhere, but in comparison with Thai immigration, the Canadians seem to embrace the 21st century. Still forms to complete but all online. After a few hundred clicks and a few weeks of waiting, I received enough documentation for our family to immigrate to Canada on a temporary work permit. Upon arrival at Toronto's Pearson airport we had to see the immigration officer who issued the permits and welcomed us to Canada. For the first two weeks we booked an apartment with Airbnb in Waterloo. We all enjoyed some good family time watching the Toronto Blue Js (baseball) losing and the Raptors (basketball) winning. The kids were thrilled to see games in real stadiums. However the honeymoon period was over soon and my wife and two of the three kids returned to Bangkok for the next three months. Our middle son wanted to finish his high school education in Bangkok since he only had one year left to graduate. Our daughter needed to finish her secondary  degree to be ready to start Canadian high school in fall. So I was left alone to organize our future in Canada.

             The 'Silicon Valley' got its name from the material computers are made of and everybody knows, it is in California. The 'Quantum Valley' got its name from quantum physics and few know what and where it is. What do this two valleys have in common and why would we care? Modern computer chips are made out of billions of small silicon based transistors. For example the iPhone 11 chip has 8.5 billion transistors on an area of approx. 100 mm<sup>2</sup>. To achieve these kind of densities the manufacturing process requires spatial precision in the order of a few nano meters or about ten thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair or approx. the size of hundred silicon atoms. The first commercially available computer chip, the Intel 4004, introduced in 1971, had 2250 transistors on 12 mm<sup>2</sup>. Since then the transistor density has doubled approx. every two years. Can this development continue? The answer is no. We are reaching the end of the transistor based innovation cycle i.e. computer performance, as we know it, will stagnate in the next few years. We might be tempted to think that today's computers are already fast and small enough but our market based economy needs innovation and improvement to sustain. Nobody buys an iPhone 11 a second time. Why can't we just go smaller than a few nano meters? Going smaller means to reach the domain of single atoms, molecules or any other particles. The laws of physics change fundamentally. Physics is now governed by probability and uncertainty. There is a chance that the transistor switch is 'on' or 'off'. When a few hundred atoms are involved the probabilities become classical reality i.e. a certain 'on' or 'off'. Quantum mechanics is a set of rules to deal with these probability waves. Therefore a new innovation cycle in computer technology will be based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Tell your kids to become quantum engineers, it is the future. Mankind needs a Quantum Valley as much as it needs a Silicon Valley. These two valleys can co-exist since the approach to computing is very different. A quantum computer will never replace a 'classical' computer. It may enhance computing power with particular solutions to hard problems but never replace our desk- and laptops.

             Although the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is flat and few real valleys exist, 'Quantum Valley' has been introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lazaridis" target="_blank">Mike Lazaridis</a>, the founder of Research in Motion (RIM), the company that manufactured the Blackberry smart phone. Remember, US president Obama used it because of the crispy keyboard clicks. In addition, it is the safest phone on the planet. The university of Waterloo is the center of the Quantum Valley with many startup and university spin-off companies, trying to commercialize the beauty of quantum physics.

             It is the university where Mr.Lazaridis studied as an engineer in the 1980s. His story is inspiring. The child of Greek immigrants, smart, curious, adventurous with a few quants of luck became a successful entrepreneur but never lost the enthusiasm and appreciation for basic physics even when he became filthy rich. Part of his success can probably be attributed to Canada's immigration system which until today is not afraid of foreign influx. One has to search hard to find similar stories in Europe. Most immigrants feel welcomed and when their children graduate from local universities they feel as Canadians and contribute to society and economy. The welcoming attitude of the Canadians is second to none. Not one minute in the last thirty months have I ever felt as a foreigner. In contrary it seems to be an asset and a contribution to society. To be fair, many countries do not have such a vast land area. Canada is huge, approx. ten million square kilometers which is about the size of Europe or 240 Switzerlands. Forty million people live here compared with 750 million in Europe. For sure a place with great potential. Waterloo's neighboring town of Kitchener (former name Berlin) has become a high-tech hub on its own. Companies like Google have replaced traditional automotive manufacturers. Their old buildings have been renovated and taken over by high tech enterprises. House prices have been rising steadily over the years, a sign of a thriving economy. In early 2017 the government started to introduce a 15 percent non-residential speculation tax (NRST) to curb inflation of house prices. This did little and house prices are still increasing with an annual rate of ten percent.

             Choosing the right school for our daughter, finding an apartment in the nearby area. Back in Bangkok parents taxi their kids to school every morning contributing a great deal to air pollution and traffic jams. Now here in Canada we have the opportunity to start from scratch i.e. with smart choices we do not need a car. Public transportation is good and a short daily walk to school for our daugther keeps the doctor away. The idea of challenging the system by not owning a car was exciting. Even in Canada boy's talk still centers around cars and the connected display of status. As already mentioned, the housing market is on fire in the GTA area and I was happy to finally find an apartment in a newly built apartment complex, twenty minutes walk to <a href="https://chc.wrdsb.ca/" target="_blank">Cameron Heights</a>, the only high school with an IB (International Baccalaureate) type program in the GTA area. I started to enjoy the concept of four seasons compared with the 'hot, hotter, hottest' ruedus in Thailand. Spring in the GTA area is beautiful. My new boss gave me one of his old mountain bikes, and I was on to explore the area on two wheels. Even in densely populated Southern Ontario, distances spread out and feelings of freedom start to enter the mind.

             Most of my professional life as an engineer has been in the field of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance" target="_blank">NMR</a> for short. Every organic chemist needs these instruments to analyze molecular structures. For example, tropical South East Asia (SEA) is a huge resource of natural products, mainly plants. There are still many chemical compounds which are unknown and might be potential candidates for therapeutic drugs. NMR is the most important tool to find and verify these new structures. Over the last twenty years the number of instruments in SEA has grown from a few to more than 150. Considering the average instrument price of approx. half a Million US dollars, this is a considerable business. My contribution in SEA was to bring these instruments into the university and research labs and make sure they are properly used and maintained. The thought that these machines could be used as quantum computers was very remote. While working in SEA I have heard that my former professor has been successful applying NMR principles to problems in Quantum Information Processing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing" target="_blank">QIP</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_quantum_computer" target="_blank">This application</a> is so different from our daily work with scientists in SEA that I never paid close attention. Never would I have thought that one day it would change our lives.

             Work in Waterloo is very different compared to work in SEA. I had to re-invent myself and go back to the books refreshing basic physics. No discussions about profit margins and business optimization, here we talk about interaction between particles and optimization of quantum gates. When doing business in SEA, money is always the major issue and the guiding light for descisions. Now good ideas determine the next step of a project, thanks to the support of the Canadian government. The real highlight is the work with the students in the laboratory. Discussing and brainstorming with bright young people is a rewarding experience.

             Once a year the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/programs/useqip" target="_blank">Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP)</a> is held at our laboratory. This offers a great opportunity for students all over the world to get an idea of the field of quantum science. Everyone, worldwide, can apply. The only requirement is enthusiasm for science and a bit of luck to get selected.

             In Fall of 2017 our daughter started her two year high school program. Meanwhile we have filled our apartment with Ikea stuff and it slowly feels like home. But it is just an apartment, no garden, a very small balcony to sniff a bit of fresh air. Compared with the lush garden we enjoyed in Bangkok, this feels like a step back. Buying a house seems a bit early, we do not know what the future brings and whether the two year contract would be extended. All these doubts and worries disappeared when one day my wife suggested visiting the open house session of a house for sale. An old, lovely, little house. Same street different number 19 instead of 8.

             First step into this house, and we both fell in love and logic was switched off. We moved our Ikea stuff on October 1st, hundred meter southwards. Now we have a garden, although not as lush as in Bangkok, yellow and red leafs are falling from the few large trees as we move in.

             The last, life changing event in our new Canadian lives so far was the birth of our new baby son on April 18, 2018. His name is Obi. Never have we thought we could love a dog, but this guy has invaded our hearts. Only dog owners/lovers can understand this. Obi is now the center of attention. The happiness of this dog when he chases a wooden stick in the Canadian snow is inspiring and has enlightened our family life. Would Obi be happy in Thailand?

           I wish you all an enjoyable, peaceful and successful 2020 and hopefully we meet soon in the big Mango.<br><br>
