    <h1>Canada Thailand contribution STCC Jan 2020 </h1>
    It is a Monday in December 2019. We have an appointment at 6pm,
    Huntsman pub Sukumvit, Landmark hotel. I am 10 minutes late, Thomas
    sits near the entrance door to make sure he can catch me when I enter
    the watering hole. Bruno arrives five minutes later. We hug each other. Long time no see. It is indeed a nice reunion, especially with Thomas whom I have not seen for roughly thirty months. We are here to catchup on the good old times when I still lived in the big Mango, Bangkok, the Venice of orient. A few days earlier when I arrived at Suvarnabumi airport it felt like coming home. For more than twenty years this was my home. I am homesick to this ugly, beautiful, stinky, good smelling town. 'How is Canada?' 'Fine, great nice country, clean air, just bought a lovely dog, life is great over there'. Yes indeed I went the other way. Where in the normal case burnt out ferangs from Europe and North America seek their last life adventures at places with average temperatures above 25 and average meal prices  below fife bucks. I love Thailand and why would I ever want to swap for one of the coldes places on earth, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Bruno and Thomas know the answer and begged me to come back to my beloved STCC newsletter and let you, dear reader, know it too. In fact I thought this was a bad idea. Talking about a Swiss guy moving from Thailand to Canada. After all, you all have moved heavily in your lifetimes and business careers. Everyone has a unique and interesting stories especially those arriving here in Bangkok. But the STCC newsletter has a big problem. Nobody wants to contribute and members and board members are busy to generate income to feed their families. Why wasting time, time is money. It took an order of chicken satay, a plate of spring rolls, a basket of french fries and four glasses of red wine to bribe me into writing this story. So remember this: I do not want to show off with this story about moving at the age of fifty-one from Thailand to Canada. Bruno forced me to do it, although, I have to admit that I have an emotional attachement to this newsletter. From 2013 to 2017 I was the editor in chief of this international business magazine with focus on Thailand. I ran around to interview interesting members, talked our old friend Friedrich Kuster into publishing his inurance jokes, which, sadly, were dropped once I left the big mango. So here we are, you reading, me writing about the move from exotic Thailand to cold Canada in March 2017.
